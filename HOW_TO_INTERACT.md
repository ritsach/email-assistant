# How to Interact with Your Email Assistant MCP Server

## üéØ Quick Start

Your email assistant is now configured as an MCP server! Here's how to interact with it:

## üì± Method 1: Claude Desktop (Recommended)

### Step 1: Restart Claude Desktop
1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. The email assistant should now be available as an MCP tool

### Step 2: Verify Connection
In Claude Desktop, you should see the email assistant tools available. Try asking:

```
"List all available tools"
```

You should see tools like:
- `process_unread_emails`
- `analyze_email_intent`
- `generate_email_reply`
- `get_unread_emails`
- `get_company_info`
- `search_contacts`

### Step 3: Start Using Email Tools

**Process Emails:**
```
"Please process my unread emails and tell me what actions were taken."
```

**Analyze Email Intent:**
```
"Analyze the intent of this email:
From: customer@example.com
Subject: Pricing Inquiry
Body: What are your pricing options for the premium package?"
```

**Get Company Information:**
```
"Get our company information for a sales inquiry."
```

**Search Contacts:**
```
"Search for contacts related to 'manager' or 'executive'."
```

**Generate Reply:**
```
"Generate a reply for this email:
From: Rita Achour <rita@example.com>
Subject: Contact Information
Body: can you send me the email address of your manager"
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Method 2: Direct MCP Client

### Using MCP Inspector
```bash
# Install MCP inspector
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector

# Connect to your server
mcp-inspector python /Users/ritaachour/dev/email-assistant/mcp_server.py
```

### Using Python MCP Client
```python
import asyncio
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async def main():
    async with stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(
        command="python",
        args=["/Users/ritaachour/dev/email-assistant/mcp_server.py"]
    )) as (read, write):
        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
            # List available tools
            tools = await session.list_tools()
            print("Available tools:", tools)
            
            # Call a tool
            result = await session.call_tool(
                "analyze_email_intent",
                {
                    "sender": "test@example.com",
                    "subject": "Test",
                    "body": "This is a test email"
                }
            )
            print("Result:", result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
